#Electric Meter Application
My housing society uses MyGate app, which allows users to pay the electricity bill based on the prepaid system, i.e you have to pay and according to your regular usage of electricity the money gets deducted from your account. This being a more practical and efficient way to pay for the electricity but the app lacks some basic features. So, I decided to make a better version of the electricity tab, which makes life easy for people living in my society and using the MyGate App. 

#Lack of Features in MyGate App 
1. No feature that shows how much is the monthly bill
2. No feature to predict the monthly bill making users curious
3. No feature to show how much money they have spent so far paying electricity bill 

#Features of Electric Meter App
1. Clean and user-friendly interface
2. Easy interface to add, remove, edit, reset, delete new electricity usage
3. Load feature which feeds the data directly into the application using a csv file
4. Prediction of amount of bill per month (which is a 'must have' feature) 
5. Shows money spent on electricity
